        <h1>BMI Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended
            to
            quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight
            for
            their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a
            person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between.
            These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age. Being overweight or underweight can have
            significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful
            indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required.
        </p>
        <h1>Who is BMI for?</h1>
        <p>The BMI calculator applies to most adults 18-65 years old. <strong>It is less accurate for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muscle Builders</li>
            <li>Long-distance athletes</li>
            <li>Pregnant individuals</li>
            <li>Elderly populations</li>
            <li>Young children</li>
            <li>People with a physical disability</li>
            <li>People of certain ethnicities</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>BMI does not take into account whether your weight is muscle or fat. People with a higher muscle mass, such
            as athletes, may have a high BMI but do not have a greater health risk. Those with a lower muscle mass, such
            as children who have not completed their growth, or older people, who might be losing some muscle mass, may
            have a lower BMI. During pregnancy and lactation, body composition changes, so using BMI is not appropriate.
